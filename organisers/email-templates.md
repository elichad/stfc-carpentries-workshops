## Helper and Instructor recruitment

Hi all,

I’m part of a team of people from SCD and ISIS (mostly current & former grads) who are running a series of Software Carpentry workshops in October and November for the [[CURRENT_YEAR]] cohort of graduates, apprentices, and industrial placement students who are in computing roles. The hands-on workshops cover basic and intermediate software engineering skills. [[We ran a Unix & Git workshop last year which many from the 2021 cohort attended, and this year we’re expanding the program, so we’re looking for additional helpers to support us and our attendees.]]

Helpers are present to assist attendees one-on-one with any problems or questions they have during the workshops, and also help to keep the workshop itself running smoothly. Being a helper is the easiest way to get involved with the workshops. You don't need any prior experience of helping, but you should be familiar with the tools used in the workshops you volunteer for. 

You can help with any and all of the following workshops (all sessions are [[START_TIME-END_TIME]]):
*	[[DATE]]: The Unix Shell & Version Control with Git
*	[[DATE]]: Programming in Python
*   [[DATE]]: Intermediate Research Software Development in Python (with VS Code instead of Pycharm)

If you’d like to get involved at RAL or online (even just for one half-day), please fill out this form to let us know your availability: [[FORM_LINK]]. 

We’re also looking for [[1-2]] more instructors to teach part of the courses (one or more 90-120min chunks). We’re especially keen to make sure our team of instructors is diverse and representative of all our early careers staff. If you’re a member of an under-represented group and instructing interests you, please let us know in the form above. You don’t need any prior experience, and there’ll be time to practice ahead of the workshop.

## Helper Briefing Calendar Invite

Hi all,

Thanks for volunteering to help at the upcoming Software Carpentry workshop series! In this briefing we’ll explain how the workshops are organized and what to expect as helpers. The slides and meeting recording will be shared afterwards for anyone that can’t make it on the day.

We haven’t yet planned who will be helping on which day and in which location, but by the time of this meeting we should have that information for you too.

If your availability has changed for the workshop dates, please let us know by updating or re-filling the sign-up form, or by emailing Carpentries@stfc.ac.uk.

## Attendees - advance info (few days before)

Hi everyone,

We are looking forward to welcoming you to our Software Carpentry workshop[[link to full workshop website]] on [[DATES]], where we’ll cover [[COURSE (hyperlinked)]]. We’ll be sending out final information on [[DAY_BEFORE_WORKSHOP]], but right now there are a few things we need from you to make sure everything runs smoothly. **Please read this email in full.**

#### Contact Us
If you need to contact us about anything below, or if you have any other questions, please email the organising team at Carpentries@stfc.ac.uk .

### Before the Workshop

#### Change of Plan?

Please let us know ASAP if:
* you can no longer attend the workshop
* you have any requests for accessibility adjustments that you didn’t specify when you registered
* you would like to switch from online to in-person attendance, or vice versa
* you need a computer to be provided for you (in-person attendees only)

#### Pre-workshop survey
Please complete the **pre-workshop survey**[[link]]. This is an anonymous survey which will help us to understand our audience and improve the learning experience.

#### Computer Setup
If you’re bringing your own computer to the workshop, follow the **setup instructions**[[link]] on the workshop website to install the required software.  Please do this well before the workshop so you have time to troubleshoot any issues. 

We will be running a **drop-in troubleshooting session** on [[DROP_IN_DATETIME]] (invite to follow). If you’re struggling to set up the software on your computer, come along and we’ll help you get things working ahead of the workshop.

You may need **admin rights** on your machine to install the software. If you don’t yet have an admin password set up, contact your IT support desk and they will create one for you. This can take a few days so don’t leave it to the last minute!

We’re aware that some new starters may not have received their work computer yet due to supply issues. If this is the case for you, we recommend letting us provide you with a computer for the workshop if you’re attending in person. We don’t recommend using a personal computer (though all the material should still work if you do). As above, please let us know if you need a computer to be provided for you and you didn’t state this when you registered.

### During the Workshop

#### Joining the Workshop

If you’re attending in person, you just have to show up to the location we tell you (more on this below).

If you’re attending online, look out for a Zoom link in the days before the workshop.

#### Code of Conduct

We will be following the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). In short: we strive to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct.

#### Slides and Recordings

Any slides used by the instructors will be shared after the workshop. We will also record each session.

### Extra Information For In-Person Attendees

#### Site Pass

If you are RAL-based but you have not been to the RAL site before, you will need to get your site pass in advance of the workshop. You can get your site pass between 10:00-12:00 Monday to Friday at the Site Pass Office in RAL main reception.

If you are based at another STFC site, you can get a visitor pass when you arrive for the workshop by showing your usual site pass at RAL reception.

If you can’t get any site pass ahead of the workshop for whatever reason, contact us by the end of [[WEEK_BEFORE_WORKSHOP]] and we’ll set up a visitor pass for you.

#### Location [[change according to booked rooms]]

The in-person component of the workshop is spread across two conference rooms – R34 Computer Training Room and R68 CR12. We will email you on [[DAY_BEFORE_WORKSHOP]] with the room you have been allocated to and a map showing how to get there. Each room will have its own helpers and all rooms will be connected to the central Zoom call for the workshop. Everyone will follow the course at the same pace.

The R34 Computer Training Room unfortunately does not have step-free access right now due to construction work blocking the ramp. If you need step-free access and didn’t mention it on the registration form because we said the location would be accessible (that’s our fault), please let us know and we’ll make sure you’re not assigned to that room.

### Catering
Tea, coffee, and biscuits will be provided for the morning break on both days. Water fountains will also be available nearby the rooms. Lunch will not be provided.

#### COVID safety
We are striving to make the workshop as safe as possible to attend. The steps we’re taking include:
* reducing room capacity to allow for social distancing
* using CO2 monitors to check air quality
* opening windows for air circulation
* encouraging attendees and helpers to wear masks
* hand sanitiser available around site and at tea/coffee station

## Attendees - final info (day before)

[[replying to: advance info]]

[[attachments: room allocation, maps showing how to get to physical rooms]]

Hi everyone,

We look forward to seeing you tomorrow for the [[COURSE]] workshop.

I’ve attached the allocation of attendees to rooms. Please help us keep to time by arriving promptly for the [[START_TIME]] workshop start.

The in-person rooms are the R34 Training Room and R68 CR12 [[obviously these may need changing]]; directions to those rooms are at the end of this email and I’ve also attached maps.

For online attendees, please use this Zoom link to join the workshop: [[ZOOM_LINK]] . This is the same as the calendar invite you should have been sent.   

For in-person attendees:
* [[Please facilitate COVID safety by ensuring social distancing and wearing masks as much as possible.]]
* Tea/coffee/biscuits will be available. There are also water fountains near each room. 
* Lunch will not be provided.

Finally, some reminders for all attendees:
* Please complete the pre-workshop survey[[add link]]. This is an anonymous survey which will help us to understand our audience and improve the learning experience.
* follow the setup instructions[[add link]] on the workshop website to install the required software. Please do this well before the workshop so you have time to troubleshoot any issues. There is no time allocated for software installation during the workshop.

**R68 CR12 directions:**  
Upon entering R68 from the side closest to R1, turn immediately right and follow the corridor. CR12 is the first door on the left.

**R34 Training Room directions, approaching from RAL Reception:**  
Go down the driveway between R63 and R65 (signposted ‘Training Room’) and enter the building through the doors at the end of the driveway. Go straight across the corridor to exit the building on the other side, follow the steps down and enter R12. From this point the R34 Training Room is signposted – do not follow signs for ‘R12 Training Room,’ that’s somewhere else! Follow the signage until you get to a workshop room directly in front of you. Go through the doors into that room and the R34 Training Room entrance is on the right.  

If that seems too daunting, you can instead follow the directions from the bus terminal by walking all the way around the R12 building complex until you reach the pedestrian site gate.

**R34 Training Room directions, approaching from the Becquerel Avenue bus terminal:**  
Go through the pedestrian gate onto the RAL site. Opposite and slightly to the left of the gate is an entrance to the R34 building. Enter and turn immediately left, and follow the corridor until you get to a workshop room directly in front of you. Go through the doors into that room and the R34 Training Room entrance is on the right.

If you have any questions, please contact Carpentries@stfc.ac.uk .
