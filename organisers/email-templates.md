## Helper and Instructor recruitment

Hi all,

I’m part of a team of people from SCD and ISIS (mostly current & former grads) who are running a series of Software Carpentry workshops in October and November for the [[CURRENT_YEAR]] cohort of graduates, apprentices, and industrial placement students who are in computing roles. The hands-on workshops cover basic and intermediate software engineering skills. [[We ran a Unix & Git workshop last year which many from the 2021 cohort attended, and this year we’re expanding the program, so we’re looking for additional helpers to support us and our attendees.]]

Helpers are present to assist attendees one-on-one with any problems or questions they have during the workshops, and also help to keep the workshop itself running smoothly. Being a helper is the easiest way to get involved with the workshops. You don't need any prior experience of helping, but you should be familiar with the tools used in the workshops you volunteer for. 

You can help with any and all of the following workshops (all sessions are [[START_TIME-END_TIME]]):
*	[[DATE]]: The Unix Shell & Version Control with Git
*	[[DATE]]: Programming in Python
*   [[DATE]]: Intermediate Research Software Development in Python (with VS Code instead of Pycharm)

If you’d like to get involved at RAL or online (even just for one half-day), please fill out this form to let us know your availability: [[FORM_LINK]]. 

We’re also looking for [[1-2]] more instructors to teach part of the courses (one or more 90-120min chunks). We’re especially keen to make sure our team of instructors is diverse and representative of all our early careers staff. If you’re a member of an under-represented group and instructing interests you, please let us know in the form above. You don’t need any prior experience, and there’ll be time to practice ahead of the workshop.
