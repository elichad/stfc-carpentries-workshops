# Planning Timeline

This timeline assumes a workshop will be run in early October. 

The timeline here is a summary of the key discussions and tasks involved in organising the workshop. There will inevitably be extra small actions and decisions that crop up throughout the planning process; those are excluded for brevity. You can reference the full [email archive from 2022](email-archive-2022.md) to get a more realistic idea of how the organisation process looks in practice.

## March

Recruit organisers and instructors.

Set up channels for communication among organisers and instructors.

Request funding, if internal.

## April

Initial planning meeting.

Discuss:
* what material to include
* format â€“ half days/full days, how many days, hybrid/in person/online attendance
* expected capacity
* how many volunteers are needed to cover that capacity

Actions:
* gather start dates and induction dates for graduates/apprentices/industrial placement students from the early careers coordinators
* create a 'starter pack' for those who start well before September and need to learn the skills early
* first-time instructors apply for [instructor training](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/)

## May

Discuss:
* finalize material and format
* choose dates if possible (working around any induction dates chosen by early careers coordinators)

Actions:
* set up workshop website using the [Carpentries workshop template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) (use past STFC workshop sites as reference)
* register workshop with SCD Admin team, if using their event management system
* set up registration form, working with SCD Admin team if needed
* request funding from the SSI, if applicable
* book the R34 Training Room and give Facilities IT the heads up
* book another large conference room for other in-person attendees
* circulate starter pack to any early starters

## June

Discuss:
* check website & registration form details

Actions:
* [Register workshop with the Carpentries](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/) (requires workshop website to be ready)
* Circulate registration form

## July

Discuss:

Actions:
* circulate starter pack to July starters

## August

Discuss:
*	estimate attendance from initial registrations

Actions:
*	Check updates to Git Bash, Zoom, VS Code etc. & decide on versions to use
*   Request software to be installed on machines managed by FacIT
*	Recruit helpers
*   Finalise teaching allocation

## September

Discuss:
* who will take on different responsibilities, e.g.
    * logistics
    * Zoom hosting
    * (co-)instructing
* how to receive contact from attendees (group email etc)
* whether more helpers are needed
* attendance cap & how to manage the waiting list

Actions:
* Set up Slido event(s)
* Schedule helper briefing, instructor meetings, logistics meetings, drop-in sessions

## 2 weeks before the workshop
* meet with instructors to address any questions about  material or teaching methods
* check through attendees for duplicate or invalid registrations
* do a very provisional room allocation to determine if there is sufficient space and sufficient helpers
    * seek extra resources as needed
* ask for conference rooms to be reconfigured if more seats than the default are needed (e.g. [CR12/13 setup form](https://ukri.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/thesource-stfc/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4F231844-97B6-4506-8844-06402BA95E5B%7D&file=R68%20CR12-13%20Layout%20Request%20Form.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1))

## 1 week before the workshop
* brief helpers & instructors on how the workshop is managed and what is expected of them
* prepare provisional room allocation
    * fill any spaces with people from the waiting list if possible
    * confirm helper availability for the dates/locations they're assigned to
* email attendees with general course info plus any lesson-specific instructions (e.g. what to install)
* forward calendar bookings for the course and the drop-in session
* Book catering for physical rooms (minimum 2 days ahead). Historically this has been:
    * tea, coffee and biscuits, no lunch
    * to arrive at 8:45am each day
    * for number of room attendees + 1 (to accommodate last-minute additions)
* Respond to anything that comes to the Carpentries inbox
    * accordingly track changes to attendee status (yes/no), format (online/in-person), and waiting list

## The day(s) before the workshop
* run drop-in session for attendees to get help with software installation
* finalise room allocation
* email attendees ~1 day ahead with room allocation and final reminders to install software
    * could split email different groups like online attendees, R34 attendees, etc, with only the information that's relevant for them, but it's more work for organisers
* email helpers ~1 day ahead with room allocation
* Pay for catering (can be done immediately after booking, but delaying allows for the booking to be changed if the number of attendees in a room changes drastically)
* Arrange for R34 key pickup
* Arrange for post-its to arrive
* Ensure welcome & wrap-up slides are prepared and available on Sharepoint
* Ensure all teaching material (slides, notebooks, etc) is available on the Sharepoint or GitHub

## During the workshop
* Add feedback from each day to welcome slides for the next day
* Clear authorship colours in the Etherpad at the end of each day to anonymise the feedback

## The day after the workshop
* Share recordings, slides/notebooks, Etherpad, full course material, and post-workshop survey (day after)
    * include anyone who wasn't able to attend due to things like sickness or bus disruption
    * consider including people on the waiting list who didn't get places
