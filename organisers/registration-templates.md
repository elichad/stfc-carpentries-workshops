## Helper/Instructor Registration

### Title:

Helper sign-up - Software Carpentry @ STFC

### Form Description:

Helpers are present to assist attendees one-on-one with any problems or questions they have during the workshops, and also help to keep the workshop itself running smoothly. Being a helper is the easiest way to get involved with the workshops. You don't need any prior experience of helping, but you should be familiar with the tools used in the workshops you volunteer for.

You can help with any and all of the following workshops (all sessions are 9am-1pm):

[DATE]: [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) & [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)  
[DATE]: [Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)  
[DATE]: [Intermediate Research Software Development in Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) (with VS Code instead of Pycharm)

We’re also looking for 1-2 more instructors to teach parts of the courses (one or more 90-120min chunks). We’re especially keen to make sure our team of instructors is diverse and representative of all our early-career staff. If you’re a member of an under-represented group and instructing interests you, you can let us know toward the end of the form.

[UPDATE 18 Aug 2022: We've now finalised our instructor roles for this year.]

(multiple choice)  
*You'll teach one or more 90-120min chunks from any workshop, according to your own preferences. You don’t need any prior experience, there’ll be time to practice ahead of the workshop, and all instructors have backup from each other while teaching.  
UPDATE 18 Aug 2022: We've now finalised our instructor roles for this year. However, there will be further opportunities to be an instructor in future editions of these workshops; if you express your interest here from now on, the organisers will follow up with you when planning those courses.*

* No

## Attendee Registration

Software Carpentry aims to help members of the research community get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them research computing skills. This **series of hands-on workshops** will cover basic and intermediate concepts and tools, including version control, data management, task automation and testing. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own projects and research problems.  
The workshops are aimed at new graduates, apprentices, and industrial placement students in computing roles, but they are open to anyone at STFC. **All workshops are optional**, please sign up only for the ones that suit your needs.  
These are hybrid workshops which **you can attend online or in person**. The material taught will be the same for everyone. We are working to ensure that all attendees feel included regardless of how they attend.   
Individual workshop dates:  
* [DATE]: [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) & [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)  
* [DATE]: [Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)  
* [DATE]: [Intermediate Research Software Development in Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) (with VS Code instead of Pycharm)

The workshops run from 9am-1pm on each day listed.
