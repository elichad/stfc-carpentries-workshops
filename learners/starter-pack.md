# Starter Pack

## Context

New starters in computing roles at STFC join with a broad range of prior experience, and are generally faced with learning many new tools, programming languages and methodologies from day one. To aid with this, a series of Software Carpentry courses will be delivered later this year (see below), providing a basic level of knowledge in some of the most widely-used computing technologies here at STFC.

These hands-on workshops will cover basic concepts and tools including version control with Git, task automation with the Unix shell, and software development techniques employed in a scientific research-oriented environment using Python.

Some new starters will start well in advance of these courses, and will soon require the basic skills covered within them; therefore, links are provided below for the course material, produced by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which can be self-taught if desired. We also provide some additional links for further reading, covering a few techniques and tools that are outside the scope of these courses.

## Workshop information
The dates for the Software Carpentry workshops are below, with links to the course material, which will be delivered in a hybrid format both online via Zoom and in-person at RAL. On each date listed, the workshop will run 9am-1pm.

* 4-5 Oct: [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) & [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* 11-12 Oct: [Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
* 1-2 & 7-9 Nov: [Intermediate Research Software Development (in Python)](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/)

## Help for Self-Learners

If you're working through the courses by yourself and run into problems, you can seek help in the `#support` channel of the [Software Carpentry at STFC](https://join.slack.com/t/softwarecarpentrystfc/signup) Slack workspace. Alternatively, you can email any of the instructors listed on the workshop website.
